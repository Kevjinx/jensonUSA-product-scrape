I will add a dropper post someday, but so far so good!",

I absolutely love the way this bike handles curves and uphill and downhill. I've been able to climb better with the full  suspension than I would have with my old hard tails. It feels easier to handle and the ride is smoother. It's very light. It does nicely on jumps and step downs too. I'm able to control the bike better.  For reference I'm 6'2 280 lbs and I went with the XL and it was the best choice for me.",

      "reviewText": "You can find a better full suspension MTB in this price range.....insane value for the price. I was frozen in analysis paralysis between the Marin RZ1 vs. the Giant Stance and I couldn't be happier with my RZ1-29er. I'm 6' even and 170-175lbs depending on pizza consumption, so I'm riding size large.  I've been running downhill, technical climbs, flow and rump trails, and a bit of rugged XC, and this bike takes it all in stride.Pros:Both the front and rear shock have been more adjustable than I would have expected. The slack head angle makes the slow technical XC trails a little tricky, but it provides huge benefits for climbing and speedy descents.Cons:There really isn't much to dislike, but its worth mentioning that the RZ1 does not come with a dropper post. And the stock seat post is sure long, so you cant lower the seat all the way without cutting the post down  significantly. That's an easy process with a hack saw and a file, but you can add a dropper for under $200 if you self-install.Overall, I cant recommend the RZ1 highly enough. If you're in the market for an affordable full suspension MTB then the Marin RZ1 is a smart place to invest your hard-earned coin.",

    "Trail riding is all about having fun. Trail bikes are designed to climb efficiently and descend with ease. The Marin Rift Zone 1 Bike is a speed-oriented bike that is created for the rider looking for the speed and rollover capabilities of 29\" wheels in a trail-capable package. It has a Series 3 6061 aluminum frame that has 125mm of travel on the rear and 130mm of travel on the front. The frame features Boost spacing, has ISCG05 tabs, and has internal cable routing.",
    "The Rift Zone 1 comes with a Shimano Deore 11-speed drivetrain that includes a cassette that has a hill-crushing 11-51T gear range that makes climbing and riding in rough terrain a breeze. Shimano BR-MT201 hydraulic disc brakes provide excellent stopping power so you can descend under control. Marin aluminum double-wall rims are paired with Vee Tire Crown Gem tires that can be set up tubeless so you can ditch the tubes and drop the tire pressure for a smoother ride, better traction, and fewer flats."
