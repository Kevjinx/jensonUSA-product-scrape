## Installation

`npm install`

`npm start`

This will create a `data` folder with .json files containing all the scraped data for each product category (submenu).

## Usage

The data is already scraped and saved in the `data` folder. If you want to scrape the data again, you can run `npm start` again.

## Contributing
